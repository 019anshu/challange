Specifications: This task demands that you create a web-based Dice rolling app. 
You do not need to show the dice. Just add a button “Roll the dice” and print a number between 1-6. 
It should also include the no. of times dice has been rolled.

Allowed Libraries: Bootstrap CSS can be used. No JavaScript library is allowed.

Example: It should look like this; however, you are open to modify anything you want. 
It just needs to be functional. Using bootstrap will not increase the score.
